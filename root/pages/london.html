            <h2>The London System</h2>
            <p>The London System is unlike many other openings with a specific set of moves that the game begins with. For this opening, 
                white attempts to create the same structure in almost ever game no matter what black plays (within reason).
                The moves that white would like to play are d4, Bf4, Nf3 and is typically followed by e3 and c3 in some order to build a pyramid of pawns.
                The London System has the reputation of being very solid but can be pretty boring to play against and even to play yourself as you end up making 
                the same moves in every game.
            </p>
